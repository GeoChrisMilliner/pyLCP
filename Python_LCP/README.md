# Note before running pyLCP. The cost raster maps which are input for the LCP script need to be generated using the MATLAB script. 

# Before running the LCP jupyter notebook. Make sure to setup the conda environment.
# The environment requires certain packages, which can be automatically installed by running
# the environment.yml file via the following:

# 1. In the directory where environment.yml is located run the following in the terminal:
# conda env create -f environment.yml

# Step 1 will create an environment called pyLCP

# 2. then activate the pyLCP environment with the following:
#  condaÂ activate pyLCP

# 3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
# conda list

# 4. You can now run the pyLCP.ipynb script by cd to the directory containing that file and typing:
#  jupyter notebook

# 4. To stop running the environment:
# conda deactivate pyLCP
